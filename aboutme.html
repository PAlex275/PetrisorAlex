								<p>My name is Petrisor Alex, and I'm 20 years old. 
									I'm a student at Babes Bolyai University, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science.
									I'm passionate about programming, especially the mobile zone.<br>
									How I found this great world of internet technologies?<br>
									My first interaction with a computer was at age 6 when my parents bought me one. I started with games and basic stuff like writing documents. 
									I used to sit at the computer more and more and begin to do more complex things like reinstalling the Windows, write CDs, things like that, 
									but I chose to follow the music way, and attend a music school. <br>
									I started to be better and better at playing piano, many rewards earned, and contests won. In 4th grade, 
									I participated in the national instrumental interpretation olympiad, obtaining 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4CPr53FRxE&t=85s">the special prize of the jury.</a> 
									I continued with the piano since high school, after the 8th grade I decided to change the way and go to a computer science class.<br>
									A special and interesting activity from high school was the robotics team where I was involved. In the team, I was the main programmer. <br>
									With the team, we participated in the contest First Tech Challenge and managing to obtain the 7th position out of 130 teams.<br>
									With one of the team members, I was involved in an experience change with the American School of Paris.<br>
									As you see, I'm a person who wants to be at the top, doesn't matter the context or circumstance.  
									I want to be always professional and trying to improve.
